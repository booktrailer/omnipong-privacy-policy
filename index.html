    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: June 16, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Omnipong Instant Rating</strong> Chrome Extension is designed to calculate your tournament rating based on data presented on the <a href="https://omnipong.com" target="_blank">Omnipong</a> website. This extension operates entirely in your browser and does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive information.</p>

    <h2>Information Collected</h2>
    <p>This extension does <strong>not</strong> collect or transmit any data outside of your local device. It reads visible table data directly from the web page on Omnipong.com to compute ratings. No user input, browsing history, or personal information is recorded or transmitted.</p>

    <h2>How Data is Used</h2>
    <p>Data extracted from the Omnipong website (such as win/loss ratings displayed in tables) is processed locally in your browser for the sole purpose of calculating and displaying an estimated tournament rating. None of this data is stored permanently or shared with any third party.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The extension only has access to <code>https://omnipong.com/*</code> as specified in the manifest file. This permission is required to read table data and inject a user interface into the page.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Access</h2>
    <p>No third-party services are used. All calculations are performed locally using JavaScript. This ensures your privacy and data security.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>Any changes to this policy will be reflected on this page with a new effective date. You are encouraged to review the policy periodically for any updates.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy or the extension, please contact the developer at <a href="mailto:your.email@example.com">your.email@example.com</a>.</p>
